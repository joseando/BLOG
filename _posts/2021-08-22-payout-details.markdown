We have recently farmed our first block! It was a long waited one since we are still a somewhat small pool.

We would like to take the opportunity and thank all the farmers that did stick with us, believing in us and in our concept of being a trustworthy fully open source pool.

With all that said, its time we are able to provide more information about or payments in the website. Although that information was already vastly available through our [API][1], it was lacking in the website.

Now the farmers can inspect every block payout by clicking in the payout ID within the explorer.

There is information about the date of the payout, amount (Chia will not always reward 1.75 XCH to pools), pool fee and number of blocks being paid for that round. There is also a table with every farmer paid, the transacion name/id it was part of and the exact value.

As always, please let us know of any issues that may arise or any feature you would like to see through our [GitHub][2].
