We are happy to announce a new feature in our website adding support for translations!

For now we are supporting German and Portuguese languages, with the help of our farmers.

We are currently using a service called Localazy as a tool to help translate all the strings.

If you would like to help translating our website to your language it would be very much appreciated! It can be done through [our Localazy][1] project. All you need to do is login, select/add the language you would like to add and start filling out the blanks.

We will do out best to keep the new strings up-to-date and integrate any new contributions.

As always, please let us know of any issues that may arise or any feature you would like to see through our [GitHub][2].
