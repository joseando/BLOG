We would like our farmers to know a small feature has been added to the website, a search box for the farmer, within our [Explorer][1].

That search box can be used to look up for a launcher id or a friendly name set by the farmer.

If a single farmer is found the user will be redirected to the farmer details page.

Once again, if you have any bugs to report or would like to suggest any improvement, please file it in [github][1].
Pull requests are also very welcome.
